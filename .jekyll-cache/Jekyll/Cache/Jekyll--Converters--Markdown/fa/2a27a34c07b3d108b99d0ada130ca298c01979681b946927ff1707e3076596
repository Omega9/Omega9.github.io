<p><a href="https://github.com/Omega9/Midi0-Toys/tree/master/MJammer"><strong>MJammer</strong></a> is made for use with midi-mapper called <a href="http://www.codefn42.com/notemapper.html">NoteMapper</a>.
NoteMapper allows to remap your midi-keyboard to play a diatonic or any other scale instead of plain chromatic scale.
You can use up to 16 mappings according to 16 midi-channels.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> is device that you actually playing.
“Input note” indicates the key you’ve pressed and “Output note” indicates the note coming outside of MJammer</p>

<p><strong>CHANNEL</strong> is to change a channel inside NoteMapper or, obviously, to change a scale. For example, from Major (Ch.1) to Minor (Ch.2).
“Input note” is the central note and allows you to choose the more suitable.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSPOSITION</strong> speaks for itself. You press a key and the tonic is changing.</p>

<p>Little buttons beside drop-down menus is a panic buttons.</p>
