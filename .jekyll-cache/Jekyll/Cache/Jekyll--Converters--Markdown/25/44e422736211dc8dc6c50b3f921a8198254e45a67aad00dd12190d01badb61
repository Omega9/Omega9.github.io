<p><a href="https://github.com/Omega9/Midi0-Toys/tree/master/Metronomes">Metronomes</a> -
collection of metronome sounds found all over the internets.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.plogue.com/products/sforzando/">SFZ-patch</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Omega9/Midi0-Toys/blob/master/Metronomes/Metronomes.multisample">Bitwig multisample</a> contains notes from C3 to G4 with two levels of velocity (velocity levels 100-127 for first beat, 0-99 for subsequent beat).</p>

<p>There’s also <a href="https://github.com/Omega9/Midi0-Toys/blob/master/Metronomes/Metronomes.alp">Ableton Live pack</a>, but it’s not completed yet. The problem is that I can’t figure out how to properly export. For now it’s a project with samples and clips, not a sample library.
If you know how to do it, contributions are always welcomed.</p>
