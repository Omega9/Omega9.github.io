_Not Max4Live, just Max patch for now._

[**MJammer**](https://github.com/Omega9/Midi0-Toys/tree/master/MJammer) is made for use with midi-mapper called [NoteMapper](http://www.codefn42.com/notemapper.html).
NoteMapper allows to remap your midi-keyboard to play a diatonic or any other scale instead of plain chromatic scale.
You can use up to 16 mappings according to 16 midi-channels.

**NOTE** is device that you actually playing.
"Input note" indicates the key you've pressed and "Output note" indicates the note coming outside of MJammer

**CHANNEL** is to change a channel inside NoteMapper or, obviously, to change a scale. For example, from Major (Ch.1) to Minor (Ch.2).
"Input note" is the central note and allows you to choose the more suitable.

**TRANSPOSITION** speaks for itself. You press a key and the tonic is changing.

Little buttons beside drop-down menus is a panic buttons.
