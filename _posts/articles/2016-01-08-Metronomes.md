[Metronomes][0] -
collection of metronome sounds found all over the internets.

[SFZ-patch][1] and [Bitwig multisample][2] contains notes from C3 to G4 with two levels of velocity (velocity levels 100-127 for first beat, 0-99 for subsequent beat).

There's also [Ableton Live pack][3], but it's not completed yet. The problem is that I can't figure out how to properly export. For now it's a project with samples and clips, not a sample library.
If you know how to do it, contributions are always welcomed.
