#### The distribution is made in two versions:

- The full bundle contains discography in formats with [lossless][2] compression ([FLAC][3]) and [lossy][4] ([MP3][5] and [OGG Vorbis][6]) in those cases where original files are lost. In addition, the bundle includes the videos and the records selection dated before 2007.
*~ 10.1GB*

- The lite bundle includes the entire discography in MP3 and OGG Vorbis formats. *~ 1.6GB*

The bundles are being regularly replenished.

Links to downloading the copy from Cloud remain unchanged as long as possible.

The current [.torrent][8] files for distribution in both bundles are distributed with this document.
